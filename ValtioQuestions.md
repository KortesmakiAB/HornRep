### Valtio Questions

I am using proxies up and down my application, but I don't really know what it is. What is a proxy?

I'm not sure I understand the use case for `subscribe()` and `unsubscribe()`. I am exporting and importing the proxy state and it seems to be working. Can you help me understand what `subscribe()` and `unsubscribe()` do and how to use them?

Do you use the macro `useProxy()`?

Do you use Valtio for all of your state or do also use 'regular' state? If so, when?

Using Valtio, I don't have a good way to see what's in state like I did with React DevTools extension.
Do you use the Redux DevTools extension?

Do you have any opinions on best practices for organizing state? The docs made some suggestions, I tried 'Action methods defined in state' and 'Action methods using `this`'. Both seemed fine.
