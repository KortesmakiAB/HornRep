# HornRep.org


## Description
What if a horn player/teacher, like me, could search for solo repertoire for the horn using filters like, range, duration, difficulty, style, gender of composer, nationality, etc.? These are the questions the app aims to solve. I believe this tool will be extremely valuable across academia, as well as high school students and professionals alike.

## Story
> "*HornRep* is a product of Dr. Sarah Schouten's doctoral dissertation. She has vision for a site that will benefit the horn community by allowing players of all skill levels to review, search and find pieces."

- A colleague of mine wrote her doctoral dissertation on this topic. Initially, a friend took her research and put a site together, although the site only partially realized the original vision of Dr. Schouten...
    - Searching capability is very limited 
    - UX is counterintuitive
    - Does not provide a forum for shared information

## Vision
- I am giving a complete overhaul to the site: all new front-end, back-end, and db. I have kept her research and intent, and have discarded the rest. 

## Stack
#####  db
- PostgreSQL
##### backend
- Node/Express
##### frontend
- React
- Valtio - an easier way to manage state
- Blueprintjs - front end React library for data-dense applications


NB: as of 7/19/21 the site is not yet hosted.
