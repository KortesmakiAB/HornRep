### `<Works>`
- Display list of works
- Displays only: Composer, Title, Duration, Level, Era/Style
- Use cards for mobile friendly
- links to `<WorkDetails>`
- handle 'No Results' (sep component?)

### `<WorkDetails>`
- write frontend api to call backend for 1 work details
- call that api
    - somehow wait until the data is loaded to render
    - need a global `<Loading>` which uses a BP spinner
        - add this to `<Home>` as well
        - BP skeleton is also an issue, but prob too much work right now
- display
